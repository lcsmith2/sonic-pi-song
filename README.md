## Generated Song: First Snow
This repository contains code written in Sonic Pi that generates a relaxing song titled First Snow. It also has Processing code for an animation transitioning from rain to snow that goes with the song. As the title implies, the song is meant to relate to experiencing the first snowfall of the year. The music starts with a series of chords that are played throughout the piece. As the song progresses, more sounds are added such as a wind sound effect and later on, a melody played on a kalimba. The introduction of the kalimba indicates where the weather starts to transition from rain to snow. Closer to the end of the song, these extra elements eventually fade away, leaving just the original chords to provide a quiet end to the music.

## Running the Code for the Song
The song code needs to be run in Sonic Pi, which can be downloaded [here](https://sonic-pi.net/). Once the files and Sonic Pi have been downloaded, in Sonic Pi's menu, select Code -> Load and then navigate to where `FirstSnow.rb` was stored and open the file. Then, click the run button in the top left. The music can also be played without the code with `first snow.wav`, which is also in the repository.

## Running the Code for the Animation
The animation code needs to be run in Processing, which can be downloaded [here](https://processing.org/). Once the files and Processing have been downloaded, open the `RainToSnow` folder in Processing. Then, click the run button in the top left to run the animation. The current constants were set to have the animation transition and total runtime match up to the song, but these can be changed.
